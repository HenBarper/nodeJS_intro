Task 1: Intro to Node JS
- In this first video we learned some basics about Node js...
    1) Node runs on a server - not in a browser (backend not frontend)
    2) The console is the terminal window
    3) Global object instead of window object
    4) Has common core modules that we explored
        - os, path
    5) CommonJS modules instead of ES6 modules
    6) Missing some JS APIs like fetch
- How to import common core modules as well as our own functions
- How to run node
    - type 'node' in terminal
- How to run a file in node
    - type 'node <filename>'
